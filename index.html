                    Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is an
                    Oceanian country comprising the mainland of the Australian
                    continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller
                    islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total
                    area. Neighbouring countries include Papua New Guinea,
                    Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands
                    and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the
                    south-east. For at least 40,000 years before the first
                    British settlement in the late 18th century, Australia was
                    inhabited by indigenous Australians, who spoke languages
                    grouped into roughly 250 language groups. After the European
                    discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606,
                    Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in
                    1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to
                    the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The
                    population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the
                    continent was explored and an additional five self-governing
                    crown colonies were established. On 1 January 1901, the six
                    colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia.
                    Since federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal
                    democratic political system that functions as a federal
                    parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy
                    comprising six states and several territories. The
                    population of 23.6 million is highly urbanised and heavily
                    concentrated in the eastern states and on the coast.
                    Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest
                    in the world, with the world's 12th-largest economy. In 2014
                    Australia had the world's fifth-highest per capita income.
                    Australia's military expenditure is the world's
                    13th-largest. With the second-highest human development
                    index globally, Australia ranks highly in many international
                    comparisons of national performance, such as quality of
                    life, health, education, economic freedom, and the
                    protection of civil liberties and political rights.
                    Australia is a member of the United Nations, G20,
                    Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic
                    Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade

                    Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the
                    largest country in both South America and the Latin American
                    region. It is the world's fifth-largest country, both by
                    geographical area and by population. It is the largest
                    Portuguese-speaking country in the world, and the only one
                    in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east,
                    Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 km (4,655 mi). It borders
                    all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile
                    and occupies 47.3 percent of the continent of South America.
                    Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home
                    to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and
                    extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected
                    habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil
                    one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of
                    significant global interest and debate regarding
                    deforestation and environmental protection. Brazil was
                    inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in
                    1500 of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral, who claimed the area
                    for the Portuguese Empire. Brazil remained a Portuguese
                    colony until 1808, when the capital of the empire was
                    transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the
                    colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the
                    formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the
                    Algarves. Independence was achieved in 1822 with the
                    creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed
                    under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system.
                    The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to
                    the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the
                    National Congress. The country became a presidential
                    republic in 1889 following a military coup d'état. An
                    authoritarian military junta came to power in 1964 and ruled
                    until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed.
                    Brazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines
                    it as a federal republic. The federation is composed of the
                    union of the Federal District, the 26 states, and the 5,570
                    municipalities. Brazil's economy is the world's
                    ninth-largest by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by GDP
                    (PPP) as of 2015. A member of the BRICS group, Brazil until
                    2010 had one of the world's fastest growing major economies,
                    with its economic reforms giving the country new
                    international recognition and influence. Brazil's national
                    development bank plays an important role for the country's
                    economic growth. Brazil is a founding member of the United
                    Nations, the G20, BRICS, Unasul, Mercosul, Organization of
                    American States, Organization of Ibero-American States, CPLP
                    and the Latin Union. Brazil is a regional power in Latin
                    America and a middle power in international affairs, with
                    some analysts identifying it as an emerging global power.
                    One of the world's major breadbaskets, Brazil has been the
                    largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.

                    Canada is a country, consisting of ten provinces and three
                    territories, in the northern part of the continent of North
                    America. It extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and
                    northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million
                    square kilometres (3.85 million square miles) in total,
                    making it the world's second-largest country by total area
                    and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's common
                    border with the United States forms the world's longest land
                    border. Canada is sparsely populated overall, the majority
                    of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra
                    as well as the mountain range of the Rocky Mountains; about
                    four-fifths of the population live near to the southern
                    border. The majority of Canada has a cold or severely cold
                    winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. The
                    land now called Canada has been inhabited for millennia by
                    various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th
                    century, British and French colonies were established on the
                    region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various
                    conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American
                    territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what
                    mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North
                    America Act, on July 1, 1867, three colonies joined to form
                    the autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. This began an
                    accretion of provinces and territories to the new
                    self-governing Dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada
                    near total independence with the Statute of Westminster 1931
                    and full sovereignty was attained when the Canada Act 1982
                    severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British
                    parliament. Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and
                    a constitutional monarchy, Queen Elizabeth II being the
                    current head of state. The country is officially bilingual
                    at the federal level. It is one of the world's most
                    ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of
                    large-scale immigration from many countries, with a
                    population of approximately 35 million as of 2015. Its
                    advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world,
                    relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and
                    well-developed international trade networks. Canada's long
                    and complex relationship with the United States has had a
                    significant impact on its economy and culture. Canada is a
                    developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world,
                    with the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally,
                    and the eighth highest ranking in the Human Development
                    Index. It ranks among the highest in international
                    measurements of government transparency, civil liberties,
                    quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is
                    a Commonwealth Realm member of the Commonwealth of Nations,
                    a member of the Francophonie, and part of several major
                    international and intergovernmental institutions or
                    groupings including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
                    the G8, the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American Free
                    Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
                    forum.

                    China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a
                    sovereign state in East Asia. It is the world's most
                    populous country, with a population of over 1.35 billion.
                    The PRC is a single-party state governed by the Communist
                    Party, with its seat of government in the capital city of
                    Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five
                    autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities
                    (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing), and two mostly
                    self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and
                    Macau); while claiming sovereignty over Taiwan. Covering
                    approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is the
                    world's second-largest country by land area, and either the
                    third or fourth-largest by total area, depending on the
                    method of measurement.[i] China's landscape is vast and
                    diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and
                    Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests
                    in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian
                    Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and Central
                    Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and
                    sixth-longest in the world, run from the Tibetan Plateau to
                    the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline
                    along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi)
                    long, and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South
                    China Seas. China is a cradle of civilization, with its
                    known history beginning with an ancient civilization - one
                    of the world's earliest - that flourished in the fertile
                    basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For
                    millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary
                    monarchies, known as dynasties, beginning with the
                    semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin(c. 2800
                    BCE)[citation needed]. Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty
                    first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the
                    country has expanded, fractured and reformed numerous times.
                    The Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the last dynasty in
                    1911, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949. After World
                    War II, the Communist Party defeated the nationalist
                    Kuomintang in mainland China and established the People's
                    Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the
                    Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present
                    capital of Taipei. China had the largest and most complex
                    economy in the world for most of the past two thousand
                    years, during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and
                    decline. Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978,
                    China has become one of the world's fastest-growing major
                    economies. As of 2014, it is the world's second-largest
                    economy by nominal total GDP and largest by purchasing power
                    parity (PPP). China is also the world's largest exporter and
                    second-largest importer of goods. China is a recognized
                    nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing
                    army, with the second-largest defence budget. The PRC has
                    been a United Nations member since 1971, when it replaced
                    the ROC as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
                    China is also a member of numerous formal and informal
                    multilateral organizations, including the WTO, APEC, BRICS,
                    the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BCIM and the
                    G-20. China is a great power and a major regional power
                    within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential
                    superpower.

                    Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country
                    comprising the islands of Cuba, Isla de la Juventud and
                    several archipelagos in the Caribbean Sea. The capital and
                    largest city Havana is 365 km (227 mi) from Miami, Florida,
                    and geographically it is considered part of North America.
                    Culturally, Cuba is considered part of Latin America. Prior
                    to Spanish colonization in the late 15th century, Cuba was
                    inhabited by Amerindian tribes. It remained a colony of
                    Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898, which led to
                    nominal independence as a de facto U.S. protectorate in
                    1902. As a fragile republic, Cuba attempted to strengthen
                    its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization
                    and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of
                    Fulgencio Batista in 1952. Further unrest and instability
                    led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the July 26
                    movement, which afterwards established a government under
                    the leadership of Fidel Castro. Since 1965, the country has
                    been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba. Cuba is the
                    largest island in the Caribbean, and the second-most
                    populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants.
                    It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and
                    customs derive from diverse origins, including the
                    aboriginal Taíno and Ciboney peoples, the long period of
                    Spanish colonialism, the introduction of African slaves, and
                    a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the Cold War.
                    Although it fares poorly in metrics of political and
                    economic freedom, Cuba is ranked very high in human
                    development by the United Nations, and performs well in
                    health and education. In 2015, it became the first country
                    to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and
                    syphilis, a milestone hailed by the World Health
                    Organization as "one of the greatest public health
                    achievements possible".

                    Egypt, officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a
                    transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of
                    Africa and southwest corner of Asia, via a land bridge
                    formed by the Sinai Peninsula. It is the world's only
                    contiguous Eurafrasian nation. Most of Egypt's territory of
                    1,010,408 square kilometres (390,000 sq mi) lies within the
                    Nile Valley. Egypt is a Mediterranean country. It is
                    bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the
                    Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and
                    south, Sudan to the south and Libya to the west. Egypt has
                    one of the longest histories of any modern country, arising
                    in the tenth millennium BC as one of the world's first
                    nation states. Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient
                    Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of
                    writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and
                    central government in history. Iconic monuments such as the
                    Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, as well the ruins of
                    Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings,
                    reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of
                    archaeological study and popular interest worldwide. Egypt's
                    rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national
                    identity, having endured and at times assimilated various
                    foreign influences, including Greek, Persian, Roman, Arab,
                    Ottoman, and European. Although Christianised during the
                    Common Era, it was subsequently Islamised due to the Islamic
                    conquests of the 7th century. With over 90 million
                    inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North
                    Africa and the Arab World, the third-most populous in Africa
                    (after Nigeria and Ethiopia), and the fifteenth-most
                    populous in the world. The great majority of its people live
                    near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about 40,000
                    square kilometres (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable land
                    is found. The large regions of the Sahara desert, which
                    constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely
                    inhabited. About half of Egypt's residents live in urban
                    areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres
                    of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the
                    Nile Delta. Modern Egypt is considered to be a regional and
                    middle power, with significant cultural, political, and
                    military influence in North Africa, the Middle East and the
                    Muslim world. Its economy is one of the largest and most
                    diversified in the Middle East, with sectors such as
                    tourism, agriculture, industry and services at almost equal
                    production levels. In 2011, longtime President Hosni Mubarak
                    stepped down amid mass protests. Later elections saw the
                    rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was ousted by the army
                    a year later amid mass protests.

                    Ethiopia, officially known as the Federal Democratic
                    Republic of Ethiopia, is a country located in the Horn of
                    Africa. It is bordered by Eritrea to the north and
                    northeast, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South
                    Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south. With over 100
                    million inhabitants, Ethiopia is the most populous
                    landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most
                    populous nation on the African continent after Nigeria. It
                    occupies a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres
                    (420,000 sq mi), and its capital and largest city is Addis
                    Ababa. Some of the oldest evidence for anatomically modern
                    humans has been found in Ethiopia, which is widely
                    considered the region from which Homo sapiens first set out
                    for the Middle East and points beyond. According to
                    linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations
                    settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era.
                    Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BC, Ethiopia was a
                    monarchy for most of its history. During the first centuries
                    AD the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in
                    the region. followed by Abyssinia circa 1137. Ethiopia
                    derived prestige with its uniquely successful military
                    resistance during the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa,
                    becoming the only African country to defeat a European
                    colonial power and retain its sovereignty. Subsequently,
                    many African nations adopted the colors of Ethiopia's flag
                    following their independence. It was the first independent
                    African member of the 20th-century League of Nations and the
                    United Nations. In 1974, at the end of Haile Selassie's
                    reign, power fell to a communist military junta known as the
                    Derg, backed by the Soviet Union, until it was defeated by
                    the EPRDF, which has ruled since about the time of the
                    collapse of the USSR in 1991. Ethiopia is a multilingual
                    nation with around 80 ethnolinguistic groups, the three
                    largest of which are the Tigray, Oromo and Amhara. Most
                    people in the country speak Afroasiatic languages of the
                    Cushitic or Semitic branches. Additionally, Omotic languages
                    are spoken by Omotic ethnic minority groups inhabiting the
                    southern regions, and languages from the Nilo-Saharan phylum
                    are also spoken by the nation's Nilotic ethnic minorities.
                    Ethiopia is the origin of the coffee bean. It is a land of
                    natural contrasts, with its vast fertile West, jungles, and
                    numerous rivers, the world's hottest settlement of Dallol in
                    its north, Africa's largest continuous mountain ranges and
                    the largest cave in Africa at Sof Omar. Ethiopia has the
                    most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. Ethiopia's
                    ancient Ge'ez script, also known as Ethiopic, is one of the
                    oldest alphabets still in use in the world. The Ethiopian
                    calendar, which is seven years and around three months
                    behind the Gregorian calendar, co-exists alongside the Oromo
                    calendar. A slight majority of the population adheres to
                    Christianity (mainly the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church
                    and Pentay), while around a third follows Islam (primarily
                    the Sunni denomination). The country is the site of the
                    Hijrah to Abyssinia and the oldest Muslim settlement in
                    Africa at Negash. A substantial population of Ethiopian
                    Jews, known as Beta Israel, resided in Ethiopia until the
                    1980s but most of them have since gradually emigrated to
                    Israel. Ethiopia is one of the founding members of the UN,
                    the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned Movement, G-77 and
                    the Organisation of African Unity, with Addis Ababa serving
                    as the headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African
                    Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the UNECA, African
                    Aviation Training HQ, the African Standby Force and much of
                    global NGOs focused on Africa. Despite being the main source
                    of the Nile, the longest river on Earth, Ethiopia underwent
                    a series of famines in the 1980s, exacerbated by civil wars
                    and adverse geopolitics. The country has begun to recover
                    recently and now has the largest economy (by GDP) in East
                    Africa and Central Africa. According to Global Fire Power,
                    Ethiopia has the 46th most powerful military in the world.

                    Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a
                    federal parliamentary republic in western-central Europe. It
                    includes 16 constituent states and covers an area of 357,021
                    square kilometres (137,847 sq mi) with a largely temperate
                    seasonal climate. Its capital and largest city is Berlin.
                    With 81 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous
                    member state in the European Union. After the United States,
                    it is the second most popular migration destination in the
                    world. Various Germanic tribes have occupied northern
                    Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania
                    was documented before 100 CE. During the Migration Period
                    the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the
                    10th century, German territories formed a central part of
                    the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern
                    German regions became the centre of the Protestant
                    Reformation. The rise of Pan-Germanism inside the German
                    Confederation resulted in the unification of many of the
                    German states in 1871 into the Prussian-dominated German
                    Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of
                    1918-1919, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary
                    Weimar Republic. The establishment of the Third Reich in
                    1933 led to World War II and the Holocaust. After 1945,
                    Germany split into two states, East Germany and West
                    Germany. In 1990, the country was reunified. In the 21st
                    century, Germany is a great power and has the world's
                    fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, as well as the
                    fifth-largest by PPP. As a global leader in several
                    industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's
                    third-largest exporter and importer of goods. Germany is a
                    developed country with a very high standard of living
                    sustained by a skilled and productive society. It upholds a
                    social security and universal health care system,
                    environmental protection and a tuition-free university
                    education. Germany was a founding member of the European
                    Union in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and became a
                    co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany is a member of
                    the United Nations, NATO, the G8, the G20, and the OECD. The
                    national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the
                    world. Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been
                    continuously the home of influential artists, philosophers,
                    musicians, sportsmen, entrepreneurs, scientists and
                    inventors.

                    Guatemala, officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a
                    country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north
                    and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the
                    northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east
                    and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated
                    population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populous
                    state in Central America. A representative democracy,
                    Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de
                    la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City. The territory of
                    modern Guatemala once formed the core of the Mayan
                    civilization, which extended across Mesoamerica. Most of the
                    country was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century,
                    becoming part of the viceroyalty of New Spain. Guatemala
                    attained independence in 1821 as part of the Federal
                    Republic of Central America, which dissolved in 1841. From
                    the mid to late 19th century, Guatemala experienced chronic
                    instability and civil strife. Beginning in the early 20th
                    century, it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the
                    United Fruit Company and the United States government. In
                    1944, authoritarian leader Jorge Ubico was overthrown by a
                    pro-democratic military coup, initiating a decade-long
                    revolution that led to sweeping social and economic reforms.
                    A U.S.-backed military coup in 1954 ended the revolution and
                    installed a dictatorship. From 1960 to 1996, Guatemala
                    endured a bloody civil war fought between the U.S.-backed
                    government and leftist rebels, which included massacres of
                    the Mayan population perpetrated by the military. Since a
                    United Nations-negotiated peace accord, Guatemala has
                    witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic
                    elections, though it continues to struggle with high rates
                    of poverty, crime, drug trade, and instability. Guatemala's
                    abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems,
                    which includes a large number of endemic species,
                    contributes to Mesoamerica's designation as a biodiversity
                    hotspot. The country is also known for its rich and distinct
                    culture, which is characterized by a fusion of Spanish and
                    Indigenous influences.

                    Iran, also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic
                    of Iran, is a country in Western Asia. It is bordered to the
                    northwest by Armenia, the de facto Nagorno-Karabakh, and
                    Azerbaijan; with Kazakhstan and Russia across the Caspian
                    Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by
                    Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf
                    and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq.
                    Comprising a land area of 1,648,195 km2 (636,372 sq mi), it
                    is the second-largest nation in the Middle East and the
                    18th-largest in the world. With 78.4 million inhabitants,
                    Iran is the world's 17th most populous nation. It is the
                    only country that has both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean
                    coastline. Iran has long been of geostrategic importance
                    because of its central location in Eurasia and Western Asia,
                    and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz. Iran is home to
                    one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the
                    formation of the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms in
                    3200–2800 BC. The Iranian Medes unified the area into the
                    first of many empires in 625 BC, after which it became the
                    dominant cultural and political power in the region. Iran
                    reached the pinnacle of its power during the Achaemenid
                    Empire founded by Cyrus the Great in 550 BC, which at its
                    greatest extent comprised major portions of the ancient
                    world, stretching from parts of the Balkans
                    (Thrace-Macedonia, Bulgaria-Paeonia) and Eastern Europe
                    proper in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east, making
                    it the largest empire the world had yet seen. The empire
                    collapsed in 330 BC following the conquests of Alexander the
                    Great. The Parthian Empire emerged from the ashes and was
                    succeeded by the Sassanid Dynasty in 224 AD, under which
                    Iran again became one of the leading powers in the world,
                    along with the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more
                    than four centuries. In 633 AD, Rashidun Muslims invaded
                    Iran and conquered it by 651 AD, largely replacing the
                    indigenous faiths of Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism. Iran
                    became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age,
                    producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists,
                    and thinkers. Establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501,
                    which promoted Twelver Shia Islam as the official religion,
                    marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian
                    and Muslim history. Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran
                    reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid
                    Empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most
                    powerful empire at the time. During the 19th century, Iran
                    irrevocably lost swaths of its territories in the Caucasus
                    which made part of the concept of Iran for centuries, to
                    neighboring Imperial Russia. Popular unrest culminated in
                    the Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906, which
                    established a constitutional monarchy and the nation's first
                    parliament. Following a coup d'état instigated by the U.K.
                    and the U.S. in 1953, Iran gradually became close allies
                    with the United States and the rest of the West, remained
                    secular, but grew increasingly autocratic. Growing dissent
                    against foreign influence and political repression
                    culminated in the 1979 Revolution, which led to the
                    establishment of an Islamic republic on 1 April 1979. Tehran
                    is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its
                    leading cultural and economic center. Iran is a major
                    regional and middle power, exerting considerable influence
                    in international energy security and the world economy
                    through its large reserves of fossil fuels, which include
                    the largest natural gas supply in the world and the
                    fourth-largest proven oil reserves. Iran's rich cultural
                    legacy is reflected in part by its 19 UNESCO World Heritage
                    Sites, the fourth-largest number in Asia and 12th-largest in
                    the world. Iran is a founding member of the UN, ECO, NAM,
                    OIC, and OPEC. Its political system is based on the 1979
                    Constitution which combines elements of a parliamentary
                    democracy with a theocracy governed by Islamic jurists under
                    the concept of a Supreme Leadership. A multicultural nation
                    comprising numerous ethnic and linguistic groups, most
                    inhabitants are officially Shia, and Persian is the official
                    language.

                    Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary
                    parliamentary republic in Europe.[note 1] Italy covers an
                    area of 301,338 km2 (116,347 sq mi) and has a largely
                    temperate climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to
                    in Italy as lo Stivale (the Boot). With 61 million
                    inhabitants, it is the 4th most populous EU member state.
                    Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares
                    open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria,
                    Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Since ancient times,
                    Greek, Etruscan, Celtic, and other cultures have thrived on
                    the Italian Peninsula. Rome ultimately emerged as the
                    dominant power, conquering much of the ancient world and
                    becoming the leading cultural, political, and religious
                    centre of Western civilisation. During the Dark Ages, the
                    region suffered sociopolitical collapse amid calamitous
                    barbarian invasions, but by the 11th century, numerous
                    Italian city-states rose to great prosperity through
                    shipping, commerce and banking, and even laid the groundwork
                    for capitalism. The Renaissance led to a flourishing of
                    Italian culture, producing famous scholars, artists, and
                    polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Michelangelo
                    and Machiavelli. Italian explorers such as Marco Polo,
                    Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, and Giovanni da
                    Verrazzano discovered new routes to the Far East and the New
                    World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery.
                    Nevertheless, Italy remained politically fragmented and fell
                    prey to European powers such as France, Spain, and later
                    Austria, subsequently entering a long period of decline that
                    lasted until the mid-19th century. After various
                    unsuccessful attempts, the second and the third wars for
                    Italian independence resulted in the eventual unification of
                    most of present-day Italy by 1866. From the late 19th
                    century to the early 20th century, the new Kingdom of Italy
                    rapidly industrialised and acquired a colonial empire,
                    becoming a great power. However, southern and rural areas of
                    the country remained largely excluded from
                    industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential
                    diaspora. Despite being one of the main victors in World War
                    I, Italy entered a period of economic crisis and social
                    turmoil, leading the way to the rise of a Fascist
                    dictatorship in 1922. The subsequent participation in World
                    War II on the Axis side ended in military defeat, economic
                    destruction and civil war. In the years that followed, Italy
                    abolished the monarchy, reinstated democracy, and enjoyed a
                    prolonged economic boom, thus becoming one of the world's
                    most developed nations. Italy has the third largest economy
                    in the Eurozone and the eighth largest economy in the world.
                    It has a very high level of human development and enjoys the
                    highest life expectancy in the EU. Italy plays a prominent
                    role in global military, cultural and diplomatic affairs and
                    is also considered to be a major regional power in Europe.
                    Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union
                    and the member of numerous international institutions,
                    including the UN, NATO, the OECD, the OSCE, the WTO, the
                    G7/G8, G20, the Union for the Mediterranean, the Council of
                    Europe, Uniting for Consensus, and many more. As a
                    reflection of its vast cultural wealth, Italy is home to 51
                    World Heritage Sites, the most in the world, and is one of
                    the most visited countries.

                    Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea,
                    comprising the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles.
                    The island, 10,990 square kilometres (4,240 sq mi) in area,
                    lies about 145 kilometres (90 mi) south of Cuba, and 191
                    kilometres (119 mi) west of Hispaniola, the island
                    containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican
                    Republic. Jamaica is the fifth-largest island country in the
                    Caribbean. Previously inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and
                    Taíno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule following
                    the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. Named Santiago,
                    it remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England
                    (later Great Britain) conquered the island and renamed it
                    Jamaica. Under British rule, Jamaica became a leading sugar
                    exporter, with its plantation economy highly dependent on
                    slaves imported from Africa, followed later by Chinese and
                    Indian indentured labor. All slaves were fully emancipated
                    in 1838, with independence from the United Kingdom achieved
                    on 6 August 1962. With 2.8 million people, Jamaica is the
                    third most populous Anglophone country in the Americas
                    (after the United States and Canada), and the fourth most
                    populous country in the Caribbean. Kingston is the country's
                    capital and largest city, with a population of 937,700.
                    Jamaicans are of predominately African descent, with
                    significant European, Chinese, Indian, and mixed-race
                    minorities. Due to a high rate of emigration since the
                    1960s, Jamaica has a large diaspora around the world,
                    particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United
                    States. Jamaica is a Commonwealth realm, with Queen
                    Elizabeth II as its monarch and head of state. Her appointed
                    representative in the country is the Governor-General of
                    Jamaica, currently Sir Patrick Allen. The head of government
                    and Prime Minister of Jamaica is Portia Simpson-Miller.
                    Jamaica is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with
                    legislative power vested in the bicameral Parliament of
                    Jamaica, consisting of an appointed Senate and a directly
                    elected House of Representatives.

                    Jordan, officially the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, is an
                    Arab kingdom in Western Asia, on the East Bank of the Jordan
                    River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and
                    east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, and Israel
                    and Palestine to the west. Since the dawn of civilization,
                    the country's location at the crossroads of the Middle East
                    has served as a strategic nexus connecting Asia, Africa and
                    Europe. Archaeologists found evidence on inhabitance dating
                    as far back as the Paleolithic period, later three kingdoms
                    in Jordan emerged; Edom, Moab and Ammon. The lands were
                    later part of several empires; most notably Roman Empire,
                    Nabatean Kingdom and finally the Ottoman Empire in the early
                    20th century. After the post-World War I division of West
                    Asia by Britain and France, the Emirate of Transjordan was
                    officially recognized by the Council of the League of
                    Nations in 1922. In 1946, Jordan became an independent
                    sovereign state officially known as The Hashemite Kingdom of
                    Transjordan. The capture of the West Bank by Jordan during
                    the 1948 Arab-Israeli War has showed that the Arab Legion
                    forces known today as the Jordanian Armed Forces were the
                    most effective among the Arab troops involved in the war.
                    The same year, Abdullah I took the title King of Jordan. The
                    name of the state was changed to The Hashemite Kingdom of
                    Jordan on 1 December 1948. It is a major tourist destination
                    in the region and is especially popular with expat
                    westerners seeking to live or study in its capital Amman.
                    Not only is the Kingdom considered the safest country in the
                    Middle East, but also considered as the safest Arab country.
                    In midst of surrounding turmoil it has been greatly
                    hospitable, accepting refugees from almost all surrounding
                    conflicts as early as 1948, with most notably the estimated
                    2 million Palestinian refugees and the 1.5 million Syrian
                    refugees residing in the country. Jordan continues to
                    demonstrate hospitality, despite the substantial strain the
                    Syrian refugees are holding on national systems and
                    infrastructure. It is also the only safe refuge available to
                    thousands of Iraqi Christians fleeing the Islamic State.
                    Pope Benedict described Jordan during his 2009 visit to the
                    Holy Land as a model for Christian-Muslim co-existence. 30%
                    of population was Christian in 1950, however, due to many
                    reasons (mainly the high rates of Muslim immigration) this
                    percentage plummeted down to 6% in 2015. Although Jordan is
                    a constitutional monarchy, the king holds wide executive and
                    legislative powers. Jordan is classified as a country of
                    "high human development" by the 2014 Human Development
                    Report. Jordan has an "upper middle income" economy. Jordan
                    enjoys "advanced status" with the European Union since
                    December 2010, and it is a member of the Euro-Mediterranean
                    free trade area. It is also a founding member of the Arab
                    League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
                    The country is one of the top ten largest contributors to UN
                    Peacekeeping troops. Jordan has a well developed medical
                    sector, making it a medical tourism destination. Also it has
                    one of the world's highest life expectancies, over 80 years
                    ranking it as the second highest in the entire MENA region.
                    Although Jordan has very few natural resources, it has large
                    investments, the reason behind this is the country's highly
                    skilled workforce.

                    Kazakhstan, officially the Republic of Kazakhstan, is a
                    country in Central Asia, with a minor part west of the Ural
                    River and thus in Europe. Kazakhstan is the world's largest
                    landlocked country by land area and the ninth largest
                    country in the world. Its territory of 2,724,900 square
                    kilometres (1,052,100 sq mi) is larger than all of Western
                    Europe. In 2006, Kazakhstan had become the dominant nation
                    of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's
                    GDP, primarily through its oil/gas industry. The country has
                    vast mineral resources. It has borders with (clockwise from
                    the north) Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and
                    Turkmenistan, and also adjoins a large part of the Caspian
                    Sea. The terrain of Kazakhstan includes flatlands, steppe,
                    taiga, rock canyons, hills, deltas, snow-capped mountains,
                    and deserts. With an estimated 18 million people as of 2014
                    Kazakhstan is the 61st most populous country in the world.
                    Given its large land area, its population density is among
                    the lowest, at less than 6 people per square kilometre (15
                    people per sq. mi.). The capital is Astana, where it was
                    moved in 1997 from Almaty. The territory of Kazakhstan has
                    historically been inhabited by nomadic tribes. This changed
                    in the 13th century, when Genghis Khan occupied the country
                    as part of the Mongolian Empire. Following internal
                    struggles among the conquerors, power eventually reverted to
                    the nomads. By the 16th century, the Kazakh emerged as a
                    distinct group, divided into three jüz (ancestor branches
                    occupying specific territories). The Russians began
                    advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century and, by
                    the mid-19th century, they nominally ruled all of Kazakhstan
                    as part of the Russian Empire. Following the 1917 Russian
                    Revolution and subsequent civil war, the territory of
                    Kazakhstan was reorganized several times. In 1936 it was
                    made the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, considered an
                    integral part of the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan was the last
                    of the Soviet republics to declare independence following
                    the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The current
                    President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been leader of the
                    country since then, and is characterized as authoritarian,
                    with a government history of human rights abuses and
                    suppression of political opposition. Kazakhstan has worked
                    to develop its economy, especially its dominant hydrocarbon
                    industry. Human Rights Watch says that "Kazakhstan heavily
                    restricts freedom of assembly, speech, and religion." and
                    other human rights organizations regularly describe
                    Kazakhstan's human rights situation as poor. Kazakhstan is
                    populated by 131 ethnicities, including Kazakhs (who make up
                    63 percent of the population), Russians, Uzbeks, Ukrainians,
                    Germans, Tatars, and Uyghurs. Islam is the religion of about
                    70% of the population, with Christianity practiced by 26%;
                    Kazakhstan officially allows freedom of religion but
                    religious leaders who oppose the government are suppressed.
                    The Kazakh language is the state language, and Russian has
                    equal official status for all levels of administrative and
                    institutional purposes, related to the long history of
                    Russian dominance in the region.

                    Morocco, officially the Kingdom of Morocco, is a country in
                    the Maghreb region of North Africa. Geographically, Morocco
                    is characterized by a rugged mountainous interior and large
                    portions of desert. It is one of only three countries (with
                    Spain and France) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean
                    coastlines. The Arabic name al-Mamlakah al-Maghribiyah and
                    Al-Maghrib are commonly used as alternate names. Morocco has
                    a population of over 33.8 million and an area of 446,550 km2
                    (172,410 sq mi) or 710,850 km2 (274,460 sq mi) including
                    Western sahara. Its political capital is Rabat, although the
                    largest city is Casablanca; other major cities include
                    Marrakesh, Tangier, Tetouan, Salé, Fes, Agadir, Meknes,
                    Oujda, Kenitra, and Nador. A historically prominent regional
                    power, Morocco has a history of independence not shared by
                    its neighbours. Its distinct culture is a blend of Berber,
                    African, Arab and European influences. Morocco claims the
                    non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara as its
                    Southern Provinces. Morocco annexed the territory in 1975,
                    leading to a guerrilla war with indigenous forces until a
                    cease-fire in 1991. Peace processes have thus far failed to
                    break the political deadlock. Morocco is a constitutional
                    monarchy with an elected parliament. The King of Morocco
                    holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over
                    the military, foreign policy and religious affairs.
                    Executive power is exercised by the government, while
                    legislative power is vested in both the government and the
                    two chambers of parliament, the Assembly of Representatives
                    and the Assembly of Councillors. The king can issue decrees
                    called dahirs which have the force of law. He can also
                    dissolve the parliament after consulting the Prime Minister
                    and the president of the Constitutional court. Morocco's
                    predominant religion is Islam, while the Languages are
                    Berber and Arabic. Moroccan Arabic, referred to as Darija,
                    and French are also widely spoken. Morocco is an influential
                    member of the Arab League and a part of the Union for the
                    Mediterranean. It has the sixth-largest economy in Africa.

                    Pakistan, officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a
                    sovereign country in South Asia. With a population exceeding
                    199 million people, it is the sixth most populous country
                    and with an area covering 796,095 km2 (307,374 sq mi), it is
                    the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area.
                    Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre (650 mi) coastline along the
                    Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is
                    bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran
                    to the southwest and China in the far northeast
                    respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by
                    Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also
                    shares a maritime border with Oman. The territory that now
                    constitutes Pakistan was previously home to several ancient
                    cultures, including the Mehrgarh of the Neolithic and the
                    Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation, and was later home to
                    kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures,
                    including Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turco-Mongols,
                    Afghans and Sikhs. The area has been ruled by numerous
                    empires and dynasties, including the Indian Mauryan Empire,
                    the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander of Macedonia, the
                    Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal
                    Empire, the Durrani Empire, the Sikh Empire and the British
                    Empire. As a result of the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad
                    Ali Jinnah and the subcontinent's struggle for independence,
                    Pakistan was created in 1947 as an independent nation for
                    Muslims from the regions in the east and west of
                    Subcontinent where there was a Muslim majority. Initially a
                    dominion, Pakistan adopted a new constitution in 1956,
                    becoming an Islamic republic. A civil war in 1971 resulted
                    in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of
                    Bangladesh. Pakistan is a federal parliamentary republic
                    consisting of four provinces and four federal territories.
                    It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with
                    a similar variation in its geography and wildlife. A
                    regional and middle power, Pakistan has the seventh largest
                    standing armed forces in the world and is also a nuclear
                    power as well as a declared nuclear-weapons state, being the
                    only nation in the Muslim world, and the second in South
                    Asia, to have that status. It has a semi-industrialised
                    economy with a well-integrated agriculture sector, its
                    economy is the 26th largest in the world in terms of
                    purchasing power and 45th largest in terms of nominal GDP
                    and is also characterized among the emerging and
                    growth-leading economies of the world.[citation needed],The
                    post-independence history of Pakistan has been characterised
                    by periods of military rule, political instability and
                    conflicts with neighbouring India. The country continues to
                    face challenging problems, including overpopulation,
                    terrorism, poverty, illiteracy, and corruption. Despite
                    these factors it maintains strategic endowments and
                    development potential while it has made substantial progress
                    in reducing poverty giving it the second lowest headcount
                    poverty rate in South Asia. It is ranked 16th on the 2012

                    Russia, also officially known as the Russian Federation, is
                    a country in northern Eurasia. It is a federal
                    semi-presidential republic. At 17,075,400 square kilometres
                    (6,592,800 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the
                    world, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's
                    inhabited land area. Russia is the world's ninth most
                    populous country with nearly 144 million people in November
                    2014. Extending across the entirety of northern Asia and
                    much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and
                    incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms.
                    From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with
                    Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both
                    with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia,
                    Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It
                    shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and
                    the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait. The
                    nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who
                    emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd
                    and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian
                    warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of
                    Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox
                    Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the
                    synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined
                    Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately
                    disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the
                    Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became
                    tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century.
                    The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the
                    surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence
                    from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and
                    political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the
                    nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation,
                    and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the
                    third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland in
                    Europe to Alaska in North America. Following the Russian
                    Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic
                    became the largest and leading constituent of the Soviet
                    Union abbreviated to USSR, the world's first
                    constitutionally socialist state and a recognized world
                    superpower, and a rival to the United States which played a
                    decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II. The
                    Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological
                    achievements of the 20th century, including the world's
                    first human-made satellite, and the first man in space. By
                    the end of 1990, the USSR/Soviet Union had the world's
                    second largest economy, largest standing military in the
                    world and the largest stockpile of weapons of mass
                    destruction. Following the partition of the Soviet Union in
                    1991, fourteen Independent republic nations emerged from the
                    USSR (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia,
                    Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova,
                    Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan). As the
                    largest, most populous, and most economically developed
                    republic, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the
                    Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal
                    personality (the sole successor state) of the Soviet Union.
                    The Russian economy ranks as the tenth largest by nominal
                    GDP and sixth largest by purchasing power parity in 2015.
                    Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources, the largest
                    reserves in the world, have made it one of the largest
                    producers of oil and natural gas globally. The country is
                    one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and
                    possesses the largest stockpile of weapons of mass
                    destruction. Russia was the world's second biggest exporter
                    of major arms in 2010-14, according to SIPRI data. According
                    to the Fragile States Index of 2015 by Fund for Peace
                    educational institution, Russia is in the 65th place in the
                    "High Warning" section. High values of group grievance,
                    human rights, security apparatus and factionalized elites
                    indicators are major contributors to the overall index of
                    Russia. Russia is a great power and a permanent member of
                    the United Nations Security Council, a member of the G20,
                    the Council of Europe, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
                    (APEC), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the
                    Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE),
                    and the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as being the
                    leading member of the Commonwealth of Independent States
                    (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)
                    and one of the 5 members of the Eurasian Economic Union
                    (EEU), along with Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and
                    Kyrgyzstan.

                    Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, and often
                    referred to as the Lion City, the Garden City, and the Red
                    Dot, is a leading global city-state and island country in
                    Southeast Asia. It lies one degree (137 km; 85 mi) north of
                    the equator, at the southernmost tip of continental Asia and
                    peninsular Malaysia, with Indonesia's Riau Islands to the
                    south. Singapore's territory consists of the diamond-shaped
                    main island (commonly referred to as Singapore Island and
                    Pulau Ujong in Malay) and more than 60 significantly smaller
                    islets. Since the 1960s, ongoing land reclamation has
                    increased Singapore's land area, which is highly urbanised,
                    by at least 20%. The islands were settled from the second
                    century AD by a series of local empires. In 1819, Sir
                    Stamford Raffles founded Singapore as a trading post of the
                    East India Company; after the company collapsed, the islands
                    were ceded to Britain and became part of its Straits
                    Settlements in 1826. During World War II, Singapore was
                    occupied by Japan. It became independent from Britain in
                    1963, by uniting with other former British territories to
                    form Malaysia, but was expelled two years later over
                    ideological differences. After early years of turbulence,
                    and despite lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the
                    nation developed rapidly as an Asian tiger economy, based on
                    external trade and its human capital. Singapore is a global
                    commerce, financial and transportation hub. Its standings
                    include: "Easiest place to do business" (World Bank) for ten
                    consecutive years, most "Technology-ready" nation (EIU), top
                    "International meetings city" (UIA), city with "Best
                    investment potential" (BERI), 2nd-most competitive country
                    (WEF), 3rd-largest foreign exchange centre, 4th-largest
                    financial centre, 3rd-largest oil refining and trading
                    centre and one of the top two busiest container ports since
                    the 1990s. Singapore's best known global brands include
                    Singapore Airlines and Changi Airport, both amongst the
                    most-awarded in their industry; SIA is also rated by Fortune
                    surveys as Asia's "most admired company". For the past
                    decade, it is the only Asian country with the top AAA
                    sovereign rating from all major credit rating agencies,
                    including S&amp;P, Moody's and Fitch. Singapore ranks high
                    on key measures of national social policies. It leads Asia,
                    and 9th globally, on the Human Development Index, including
                    education, healthcare, life expectancy, quality of life,
                    personal safety, housing. Although income inequality is
                    high, 90% of citizens own their homes, and the country has
                    one of the highest per capita incomes. The cosmopolitan
                    nation is home to 5.5 million residents, 38% of whom are
                    permanent residents and other foreign nationals.
                    Singaporeans are mostly bilingual, with English as its
                    common language and a second mother-tongue language. Its
                    cultural diversity is reflected in its extensive "hawker"
                    cuisine and major ethnic festivals—Chinese, Malay, Indian,
                    Western—which are all national holidays. In 2015, Lonely
                    Planet and New York Times listed Singapore as their top and
                    6th best world destination to visit respectively. The
                    nation's core principles are meritocracy, multiculturalism
                    and secularism. It is noted for its effective, pragmatic and
                    incorrupt governance and civil service, which together with
                    its rapid development policies, is widely cited as the
                    "Singapore model". Gallup polls shows 84% of its residents
                    expressed confidence in the national government, one of the
                    highest ratings recorded. Singapore has significant

                    Thailand, officially the Kingdom of Thailand, formerly known
                    as Siam, is a country at the centre of the Indochinese
                    peninsula in Mainland Southeast Asia. It is bordered to the
                    north by Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia,
                    to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to
                    the west by the Andaman Sea and the southern extremity of
                    Myanmar. Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf
                    of Thailand to the southeast, and Indonesia and India on the
                    Andaman Sea to the southwest. Thailand is governed by a
                    military junta that took power in the May 2014 coup d'état.
                    Its monarchy is headed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is
                    called Rama IX as he is the ninth monarch of the Chakri
                    Dynasty, and has reigned since 1946 as the world's
                    longest-serving head of state and the country's
                    longest-reigning monarch (he has reigned for 69 years, 179
                    days),With a total area of approximately 513,000 km2
                    (198,000 sq mi), Thailand is the world's 51st-largest
                    country. It is the 20th-most-populous country in the world,
                    with around 66 million people. The capital and largest city
                    is Bangkok, which is Thailand's political, commercial,
                    industrial, and cultural hub. About 75-95% of the population
                    is ethnically Tai, which includes four major regional
                    groups: central Thai, northeastern Thai (Khon [Lao] Isan),
                    northern Thai (Khon Mueang); and southern Thai. Thai
                    Chinese, those of significant Chinese heritage, are 14% of
                    the population, while Thais with partial Chinese ancestry
                    comprise up to 40% of the population. Thai Malays represent
                    3% of the population, with the remainder consisting of Mons,
                    Khmers and various "hill tribes". The country's official
                    language is Thai and the primary religion is Theravada
                    Buddhism, which is practised by around 95% of the
                    population. Thailand experienced rapid economic growth
                    between 1985 and 1996, becoming a newly industrialised
                    country and a major exporter. Manufacturing, agriculture,
                    and tourism are leading sectors of the economy. Among the
                    ten ASEAN countries, Thailand ranks third in quality of
                    life. and the country's HDI is rated as "high". Its large
                    population and growing economic influence have made it a
                    middle power in the region and around the world.

                    Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
                    is a federal republic located on the northern coast of South
                    America. It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on
                    the south, Guyana on the east, and the islands of Trinidad
                    and Tobago to the north-west. Venezuela's territory covers
                    around 916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi) with an estimated
                    population around 33,221,865. Venezuela is considered a
                    state with extremely high biodiversity, with habitats
                    ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon
                    Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive llanos plains
                    and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River
                    Delta in the east. The country faces severe social and
                    economic problems, such as high inflation (the highest in
                    the world), shortage of basic goods in the markets, high
                    criminality and media censorship. The territory currently
                    known as Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid
                    resistance from indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one
                    of the first Spanish-American colonies to declare
                    independence, which was not securely established until 1821,
                    when Venezuela was a department of the federal republic of
                    Gran Colombia. It gained full independence as a separate
                    country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered
                    political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by
                    regional caudillos (military strongmen) until the mid-20th
                    century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of
                    democratic governments. Economic shocks in the 1980s and
                    1990s led to several political crises, including the deadly
                    Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the
                    impeachment of President Carlos Andrés Pérez for
                    embezzlement of public funds in 1993. A collapse in
                    confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of
                    former coup-involved career officer Hugo Chávez and the
                    launch of the Bolivarian Revolution, which is a type of
                    socialist revolution, beginning with a 1999 Constituent
                    Assembly to write a new Constitution of Venezuela. This new
                    constitution officially changed the name of the country to
                    República Bolivariana de Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of
                    Venezuela). Venezuela is a federal presidential republic
                    consisting of 23 states, the Capital District (covering
                    Caracas), and federal dependencies (covering Venezuela's
                    offshore islands). Venezuela also claims all Guyanese
                    territory west of the Essequibo River, a
                    159,500-square-kilometre (61,583 sq mi) tract dubbed Guayana
                    Esequiba or the Zona en Reclamación (the "zone being
                    reclaimed"). Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries
                    in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in
                    the cities of the north, especially in the capital, Caracas,
                    which is also the largest city in Venezuela. Since the
                    discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has
                    the world's largest oil reserves and has been one of the
                    world's leading exporters of oil. Previously an
                    underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as
                    coffee and cocoa, oil quickly came to dominate exports and
                    government revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external
                    debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, in which
                    inflation peaked at 100% in 1996 and poverty rates rose to
                    66% in 1995 as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell to the same
                    level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak. The recovery
                    of oil prices in the early 2000s gave Venezuela oil funds
                    not seen since the 1980s. The Venezuelan government then
                    initiated populist/revisionist policies that initially
                    boosted the Venezuelan economy and increased social
                    spending, significantly reducing economic inequality and
                    poverty. Such populist policies were questioned since their
                    initiation and the over dependence on oil funds led to
                    overspending on social programs while strict government
                    polices, which were initially supposed to prevent capital
                    flight, created difficulties for Venezuela's import-reliant
                    businesses. Venezuela under Hugo Chávez suffered "one of the
                    worst cases of Dutch Disease in the world" due to the
                    Bolivarian government's large dependence on oil sales.
                    Poverty and inflation began to increase into the 2010s.
                    Nicolás Maduro was elected in 2013 after the death of
                    Chavez. Venezuela devalued its currency in February 2013 due
                    to the rising shortages in the country with shortages in
                    Venezuela including milk, flour, and other necessities and
                    malnutrition then increasing, especially among children. In
                    2014, Venezuela entered an economic recession. In 2015,
                    Venezuela had the world's highest inflation rate with the
                    rate surpassing 100%, becoming the highest in the country's
                    history. Economic problems, as well as crime and corruption,
                    were some of the main causes of the 2014-15 Venezuelan
                    protests, which left more than 40 protesters killed.
